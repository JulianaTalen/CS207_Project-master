# CS207_ FinalProject

This project that was complete this semester in Interactive Gadgets was an Arduino NeoPixel Traffic Map. This design displays live traffic between four popular places to visit in the southern tip of New York City. The basic structure of this design in a picture frame with a map of New York City inside of it with neopixel LEDs poking through the map. This project was completed through combing a passion of New York City and Geographic Information Science together. The basic idea of the project is to use neopixels and a Google API address with an Arduino that has Wi-Fi capabilities to gather live data from each of the sites to allow for the LEDs to change colour to reflect the traffic patterns. 

The original project, was developed by Brian Lough on Make, describes a system that would display live traffic between two locations on a physical map (Lough, Brian). He chose to do his project on the San Francisco Bridge. The project was later created again by Tyler Winegarner on Make Live where he chose to complete the project in Northern Ireland.
